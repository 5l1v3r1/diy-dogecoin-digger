<p>Mass CPU mining is important to the future of Dogecoin, if you can spare
the cycles and electrons. If you're interested in some of the reasons,
feel free <a href="https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger">bop over to the README and
hear the long and somewhat boring story of the whys and wherefores.

<h3>
<a name="step-two-start-digging-already" class="anchor" href="#step-two-start-digging-already"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Start digging already!</h3>

<p>Assuming you have a wallet, pick your operating system, and follow the
very simple instructions to get started. You can choose Linux/OSX,
Windows, Raspbian (some day), or Android (some other day).</p>

<h2>
<a name="d%C3%90d-on-linux-and-osx" class="anchor" href="#d%C3%90d-on-linux-and-osx"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DÐD on Linux and OSX</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iEMgx2U.png" alt="Linux"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Mitgpaf.png" alt="OSX"></p>

<p>The Linux and OSX version of the bootstrap script, <code>ddd.sh</code>,
requires curl, a small application useful for command-line file transfers.
Most of these systems already have it. DDD also assumes an Intel-based 64-bit
for OSX or Linux, or 32-bit Linux (for now). All MacBooks manufactured since
late 2006 have 64-bit CPUs, but if you're not sure about yours,
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3696">here's how to tell</a>.</p>

<p>So, you should be set out of the box. Just open a Terminal window, and type:</p>

<pre><code>\curl -3sSL https://bit.ly/ddd-posix &gt; ddd.sh &amp;&amp; bash ddd.sh
</code></pre>

<p>The above will get you started mining right away, but you'll be mining
to <strong>my</strong> Dogecoin address, not yours. While this seems like a perfectly
reasonable default to <strong>me</strong>, you might not agree. That's fair. You can
keep your earnings by editing the <code>p2p.conf</code> file first. Here's how:</p>

<pre><code>\curl -3sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/master/bin/ddd.sh
\curl -3sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/master/conf/p2p.conf
sed -i s/DLkmYda7gQ7U4pxQZbyJtkpnCxYrvDWa7g/YOUR-DOGECOIN-WALLET-ADDRESS/ p2p.conf
bash ./ddd.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Just copy and paste that into your Terminal window. It should work out.</p>

<p>This probably works on other Linuces. Let's keep a list of tested
operating systems on the
<a href="https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/wiki/_pages">wiki</a>! That'll
be fun.</p>

<h2>
<a name="d%C3%90d-on-microsoft-windows" class="anchor" href="#d%C3%90d-on-microsoft-windows"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DÐD on Microsoft Windows</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CVDmPUk.jpg" alt="Windows"></p>

<p>Sadly, Windows kind of fails at both having an easy command-line interface
for file transfers, and a scriptable way to unzip files. To take care of that,
you <em>may</em> need to manually download a couple things if you haven't done something
like this before.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/raw/master/bin/curl-7.35.0-win32-local-fix1.msi">cURL</a> - a crazy useful, multi-protocol data transfer utility. Free and open source.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/raw/master/bin/7z920.msi">7zip</a> - a stunningly handy archive manager. Free and open source.</li>
</ul><p>These are nice to have around anyway so you'll be happy you have them. You may need adminstrative
permissions to install one or both, though, depending on your local security settings.
Ask an adult first!</p>

<p>Once you have those installed, you can pretend like you're on Linux or OSX, and run:</p>

<pre><code>curl -3sSL https://bit.ly/ddd-w32 -o ddd.bat &amp;&amp; ddd.bat
</code></pre>

<p>Someday, we'll have a nice one-click experince for our Microshibe friends. Also,
since it's Windows, 32-bit applications still will work on 64-bit hardware. That said,
there's an <a href="https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/issue">issue</a>
open to address this and get you on the more correct platform with some auto-detection.</p>

<p>The above will get you started mining right away, but you'll be mining
to <strong>my</strong> Dogecoin address, not yours. While this seems like a perfectly
reasonable default to <strong>me</strong>, you might not agree. That's fair. You can
keep your earnings by editing the <code>p2p.conf</code> file first. Here's how.</p>

<p>First, get the p2p.conf and the <code>ddd.bat</code> batch file:</p>

<pre><code>curl -3sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/master/bin/ddd.bat
curl -3sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/master/conf/p2p.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Edit <code>p2p.conf</code> with your favorite editor and replace my "user" (really my wallet address)
with yours. Be careful to save it as a <code>p2p.conf</code> and not <code>p2p.conf.txt</code> -- Windows is
tricky like that.</p>

<p>Now you're off to the races:</p>

<pre><code>ddd.bat
</code></pre>

<a name="contribute" class="anchor" href="#contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contribute!</h1>

<p>In the grand scheme of Dogecoin, this is a pretty minor project.
But, open source things like this often end up being a one man
show, and that's a sure way to turn into abandonware in six months.</p>

<p>The fact is, there are way smarter people than me out there, with all
kinds of useful experience and knowledge. If you want contributor rights,
and I have some way of verifying that you are a trustworthy sort that's
not going to go backdoor all those noob shibes coming here, feel free to
e-mail me or hit me up on <a href="http://reddit.com/u/thegoddambatman">Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>You are welcome to just dive in, of course. The wiki is open and I love getting
pull requests. Scoot on over to the <a href="https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger">GitHub</a> repo
to start your long and storied career as a Dogecoin hacker.

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ehUkOjO.png" alt="Tipjar"></p>

<p>Of course, it's not a proper cryptocurrency project unless you leave out a tip jar. Here's mine:</p>

<p><a href="http://dogechain.info/address/DLkmYda7gQ7U4pxQZbyJtkpnCxYrvDWa7g">DLkmYda7gQ7U4pxQZbyJtkpnCxYrvDWa7g</a></p>

<p>You'll note it's the same as the default address in these one-line installers. If people really are
falling for the default wallet address trick, you can keep tabs on my apparent hashrate on <a href="http://doge.st/serverstats#DLkmYda7gQ7U4pxQZbyJtkpnCxYrvDWa7g">doge.st</a>. I promise to fix that, by
the way. I just don't have a good way to do it yet.</p>
