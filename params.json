That means providing\r\npre-configured installers that can be automatically run from the command\r\nline with little fuss and no guesswork. It also means validating all the\r\nprovided binaries and scripts with md5sums and keeping everything on\r\nSSL for download and install.\r\n\r\nMass CPU mining is important to the future of Dogecoin, if you can spare\r\nthe cycles and electrons. If you're interested in some of the reasons,\r\nfeel free to read on or [skip ahead](https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger#the-longer-story). Otherwise...\r\n\r\n## TL;DR!\r\n\r\nOh, I get it, you're the sort who doesn't care about details. You just want\r\nto be helpful. I respect that. After all, who has the time? Here's what you\r\nneed to do to start digging some Dogecoin with a P2P pool and help protect\r\nthe Dogecoin network, right now.\r\n\r\n### Step One: Get a Wallet\r\n\r\nIf you have a wallet, great, just skip ahead to the [Linux/OSX method](https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger#d%C3%90d-on-linux-and-osx)\r\nor the [Windows procedure](https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger#d%C3%90d-on-microsoft-windows).\r\n\r\n![Multidoge](http://i.imgur.com/SdFtBtgs.png)\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a Dogecoin wallet yet, then might I suggest the\r\n[MultiDoge](http://multidoge.org/) wallet? It's easy and fun, cross-platform,\r\nallows for removable keys on a USB drive, and you don't have to wait for days\r\nfor the network to sync.\r\n\r\nTo verify your download, check against the md5 hashes, here:\r\n\r\n````\r\na5788daf3b58b6a5efa222db9fd05367  multidoge-0.1.2.dmg\r\na9484de0a99ada77ebd0118a33708c72  multidoge-0.1.2-linux.jar\r\n5083cb4f664cf3a62af292e54978ee39  multidoge-0.1.2-windows-setup.exe\r\n````\r\n\r\nUnfamiliar with md5sums? [No problem](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM)!\r\n\r\nThere are many other choices in your quest for a Dogecoin address. Feel free\r\nto shop around.\r\n\r\n### Step Two: Start digging already!\r\n\r\nNow that you have a wallet, pick your operating system, and follow the\r\nvery simple instructions to get started. You can choose Linux/OSX,\r\nWindows, Raspbian (some day), or Android (some other day).\r\n\r\n## DÐD on Linux and OSX\r\n\r\n![Linux](http://i.imgur.com/iEMgx2U.png) ![OSX](http://i.imgur.com/Mitgpaf.png)\r\n\r\nThe Linux and OSX version of the bootstrap script, `ddd.sh`,\r\nrequires curl, a small application useful for command-line file transfers.\r\nMost of these systems already have it. DDD also assumes an Intel-based 64-bit\r\nfor OSX or Linux, or 32-bit Linux (for now). All MacBooks manufactured since\r\nlate 2006 have 64-bit CPUs, but if you're not sure about yours,\r\n[here's how to tell](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3696).\r\n\r\nSo, you should be set out of the box. Just open a Terminal window, and type:\r\n\r\n````\r\n\\curl -3sSL https://bit.ly/ddd-posix > ddd.sh && bash ddd.sh\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### Avoiding me ripping you off (Posix)\r\n\r\nThe above will get you started mining right away, but you'll be mining\r\nto **my** Dogecoin address, not yours. While this seems like a perfectly\r\nreasonable default to **me**, you might not agree. That's fair. You can\r\nkeep your earnings by editing the `p2p.conf` file first. Here's how:\r\n\r\n````\r\n\\curl -3sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/master/bin/ddd.sh\r\n\\curl -3sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/master/conf/p2p.conf\r\nsed -i s/DLkmYda7gQ7U4pxQZbyJtkpnCxYrvDWa7g/YOUR-DOGECOIN-WALLET-ADDRESS/ p2p.conf\r\nbash ./ddd.sh\r\n````\r\n\r\nJust copy and paste that into your Terminal window. It should work out.\r\n\r\n#### Non-Debian derived systems\r\n\r\nThis probably works on other Linuces. Let's keep a list of tested\r\noperating systems on the\r\n[wiki](https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/wiki/_pages)! That'll\r\nbe fun.\r\n\r\n## DÐD on Microsoft Windows\r\n\r\n![Windows](http://i.imgur.com/CVDmPUk.jpg)\r\n\r\nSadly, Windows kind of fails at both having an easy command-line interface\r\nfor file transfers, and a scriptable way to unzip files. To take care of that,\r\nyou *may* need to manually download a couple things if you haven't done something\r\nlike this before.\r\n\r\n  * [cURL](https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/raw/master/bin/curl-7.35.0-win32-local-fix1.msi) - a crazy useful, multi-protocol data transfer utility. Free and open source.\r\n  * [7zip](https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/raw/master/bin/7z920.msi) - a stunningly handy archive manager. Free and open source.\r\n\r\nThese are nice to have around anyway so you'll be happy you have them. You may need adminstrative\r\npermissions to install one or both, though, depending on your local security settings.\r\nAsk an adult first!\r\n\r\nOnce you have those installed, you can pretend like you're on Linux or OSX, and run:\r\n\r\n````\r\ncurl -3sSL https://bit.ly/ddd-w32 -o ddd.bat && ddd.bat\r\n````\r\n\r\nSomeday, we'll have a nice one-click experince for our Microshibe friends. Also,\r\nsince it's Windows, 32-bit applications still will work on 64-bit hardware. That said,\r\nthere's an [issue](https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/issue)\r\nopen to address this and get you on the more correct platform with some auto-detection.\r\n\r\n#### Avoiding me ripping you off (Windows)\r\n\r\nThe above will get you started mining right away, but you'll be mining\r\nto **my** Dogecoin address, not yours. While this seems like a perfectly\r\nreasonable default to **me**, you might not agree. That's fair. You can\r\nkeep your earnings by editing the `p2p.conf` file first. Here's how.\r\n\r\nFirst, get the p2p.conf and the `ddd.bat` batch file:\r\n\r\n````\r\ncurl -3sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/master/bin/ddd.bat\r\ncurl -3sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/master/conf/p2p.conf\r\n````\r\n\r\nEdit `p2p.conf` with your favorite editor and replace my \"user\" (really my wallet address)\r\nwith yours. Be careful to save it as a `p2p.conf` and not `p2p.conf.txt` -- Windows is\r\ntricky like that.\r\n\r\nNow you're off to the races:\r\n\r\n````\r\nddd.bat\r\n````\r\n\r\n# The Long and Kind of Boring Story\r\n\r\nSo if you've read this far, you may be wondering why I want loads and\r\nloads of people to start mining on their low-end, non-optimized, barely\r\nadequate gear. I mean, that's just going to kick up the difficulty rate\r\nand cost everyone a bunch of electricity, right?\r\n\r\nWell... not so fast. There are real, practical reasons to do this.\r\nIf you're used to the profit motives often talked about in cryptocurrency\r\ncircles, you may want to avert your eyes, since I'm going to talk about\r\nthe social good you can perform by sparing a little CPU power.\r\n\r\n## Initial musings\r\n\r\nFor a while, I've been worrying myself over the whole fragility of the\r\npeer-to-peer network that Dogecoin (and all other cryptocurrencies)\r\nrely on to operate. There was a mild freakout in March of 2014 about\r\nhow [Wafflepool had accumulated over 40% of the total hashing power of the network](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/210fwh/wafflepool_is_almost_in_position_for_51_attack_on/).\r\n\r\nThe problem is twofold:\r\n\r\n  * Multipools tend to mine Dogecoin quickly, then turn around and trade the DOGE for BTC.\r\n\r\nThese folks don't hold the DOGE, they don't spend the DOGE, and they don't trade for\r\ngoods and services with DOGE. They mine, dump, and mine again. Of course, it's perfectly\r\nreasonable to do this on an individual basis. You just ending up sucking the life out of the\r\ncoins you mine for your short-term gain. Shrug, right?\r\n\r\n  * Pools (multi- or not) tend to concentrate hashing power into very few hands (and machines)\r\n\r\nAll of the security of a peer-to-peer, distributed currency is predicated on the fact\r\nthat it's actually **peer-to-peer**. This is not the case today. You can usually eyeball\r\nhow the hashrate is divided right now by taking a look at [RapidHash's chart](https://pools.rapidhash.net/).\r\nIn late March, 2014, 10 pools are identified as controlling over **60%** of the hashrate.\r\n\r\nAre the controllers of these pools all going to suddenly start colluding, like so many\r\nmonocoled and cigar-smoking [robber barons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist))?\r\nProbably not. But how probably? 99%? 98%? Is it any better that it would only take the top six pools\r\nto cover over 51% of the hashrate?\r\n\r\nLet's assume the controllers of these pools -- every person who knows a password or holds a key to\r\na critical service on these pools -- are pure of heart. Even if they have the most excellent\r\nof intentions, I would bet they're not immune to getting hacked. It happens, and it happens over\r\nand over again on young sites caught up in racing to meet performance and bandwidth demands.\r\n\r\nMany people are familiar with the chaos caused when cryptocurrency exchanges go bad, since they\r\ncontrol such a large percentage of the coins already extant, and of course, they do go bad from\r\ntime to time, at various levels of fault. Imagine what happens when the network itself goes bad.\r\n\r\nSo, let's try to mitigate against that.\r\n\r\n## Enter the P2Pools\r\n\r\nThis project defaults to setting up a CPU miner to contribute its proof-of-work to a proper peer-to-peer\r\npool, [Doge.st](http://doge.st). These kinds of pools are usually referred to as a P2Pool, and Doge.st\r\nis one of several sub-pools (which itself is P2P). The crucial bit is that P2Pool (and the proxies)\r\npromote **decentralization**, while traditional and multipools promote **centralization**.\r\n\r\nYou are more than welcome to read the write up at the [BitCoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/P2Pool) as well\r\nas /u/Verrok's [introductory Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1ypd7w/hey_rdogecoin_check_it_out_ive_wrote_a_mining/) to figure\r\nout how all that works. They explain it way better than I can.\r\n\r\nOh, and since the payouts on these pools is generally pretty consistent, you're not really sacrificing much\r\nif you were already mining with one of the multipools or doge-centric pools.\r\n\r\n## [GoodShibe's](http://reddit.com/u/GoodShibe) Post\r\n\r\nFinally, the real reason why I stopped worrying and learned to love the CPU miner is\r\nGoodShibe's post, [Of Wolves and Weasels, Day 81](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/21o1k4/of_wolves_and_weasels_day_81_the_grim_reality/), which, to\r\nme, pretty much reads like [St. Crispin's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Crispin%27s_Day_Speech) \r\nstyle call to action. Therefore, in answer to his call to action, I put this together.\r\n\r\nLet's make it easy to drop CPU miners everywhere, have them all throwing in on a peer-to-peer sharechain,\r\nand drive down the influence of the pooled miners. That's my take, anyway.\r\n\r\nSee, I told you this was a long and boring story. You should have gotten a snack.\r\n\r\n# Next steps\r\n\r\nNow, I try to make this all easy so you don't have to do a whole lot but\r\nstab at some keys. You got your compiled binaries (non-nerds might call\r\nthem \"programs\" or \"apps\") in a reasonably secure way. However, if this\r\nis all just too easy for you, you are invited to go and compile cpuminer\r\nstraight from the source:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pooler/cpuminer\r\n\r\nHowever, that kind of thing is beyond this \"Total Noobs Guide\" getting\r\nstarted thing. All I care about is that lots of people mine. I don't\r\nsuper care about any one individual's hashrate, assuming he doesn't\r\nhog all the rocket juice for himself.\r\n\r\n# Contribute!\r\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of Dogecoin, this is a pretty minor project.\r\nBut, open source things like this often end up being a one man\r\nshow, and that's a sure way to turn into abandonware in six months.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, there are way smarter people than me out there, with all\r\nkinds of useful experience and knowledge. If you want contributor rights,\r\nand I have some way of verifying that you are a trustworthy sort that's\r\nnot going to go backdoor all those noob shibes coming here, feel free to\r\ne-mail me or hit me up on [Reddit](http://reddit.com/u/thegoddambatman).\r\n\r\n# Tipjar\r\n\r\n![Tipjar](http://i.imgur.com/ehUkOjO.png)\r\n\r\nOf course, it's not a proper cryptocurrency project unless you leave out a tip jar. Here's mine:\r\n\r\n[DLkmYda7gQ7U4pxQZbyJtkpnCxYrvDWa7g](http://dogechain.info/address/DLkmYda7gQ7U4pxQZbyJtkpnCxYrvDWa7g)\r\n\r\nYou'll note it's the same as the default address in these one-line installers. If people really are\r\nfalling for the default wallet address trick, you can keep tabs on my apparent hashrate on [doge.st](http://doge.st/serverstats#DLkmYda7gQ7U4pxQZbyJtkpnCxYrvDWa7g). I promise to fix that, by\r\nthe way. I just don't have a good way to do it yet.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
