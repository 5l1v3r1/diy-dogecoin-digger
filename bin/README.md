# DDD Bins

This is where the binaries live. Don't fret, they're small.

## Pooler's CPUMiner

The guts of DDD is @pooler's CPU miner (aka, `minerd`), pulled from
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpuminer/files/) .

Source and license is available [at his repo](github.com/pooler/cpuminer). While the below md5sums were verified
by me, feel free to compile yourself -- especially if you're running a funny operating system.

In the future, I'll be doing that. For now, we'll trut that SourceForge hasn't monkeyed with them and dropped
in backdoors or anything. Also, I'll get to work on binaries for funny OSes like like Raspbian (for the
Raspberry Pi) and Android (for my graveyard of crappy Android phones).

## Installers

Coming soon! That's half the point of this project after all.

## Helper applications

Some operating systems don't provide helpful tools like md5sum checkers, command-line downloaders, and the like.
Those will go here as well.

## Configuration

The default configuration file used by the installers to get you diggin' up some Dogecoin.
