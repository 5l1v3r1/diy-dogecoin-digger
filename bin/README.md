# D√êD Bins

This is where the binaries live. Don't fret, they're small and harmless.

## Pooler's CPUMiner

The guts of DDD is @pooler's CPU miner (aka, `minerd`), pulled from
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpuminer/files/) .

Source and license is available [at his repo](github.com/pooler/cpuminer). While the below md5sums were verified
by me, feel free to compile yourself -- especially if you're running a
funny operating system.

In the future, I'll be doing all the compiling so *I* know everything's
cool. For now, though, we'll trut that SourceForge hasn't monkeyed with
these binaries in sneaky ways.

This list is far from complete, of course -- getting builds together for
more exotic hardware that you might have lying around not digging for
Dogecoin is a priority around here.

## Helper applications

Some operating systems don't provide helpful tools like command-line downloaders, unarchivers, and the like.

Give me a few hours and I'll stick some VirusTotal result links here to
help show we're all on the up-and-up. Or, maybe I'm some superhacker
with secret 0day. Shrug. You never know, it could go either way.
