# Configuration details

The big thing you care about is changing the "user" parameter when you run your minerd.
The main README.md has instructions on how to do that, but I'm sure you can figure it
out. Note that on Windows, notepad.exe cheerfully screws up the ends of lines. You'll
need to use WordPad or something.

A better system for setting your own default [is coming soon](https://github.com/thegoddambatman/diy-dogecoin-digger/issues/3).
